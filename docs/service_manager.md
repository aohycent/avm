Script Manager
A good name for a script that monitors other scripts and brings them back to activity after a long delay is Script Manager.
This name is clear, concise, and accurately reflects the script's primary function: managing the execution and state of other scripts. It implies oversight, control, and the ability to intervene when necessary, such as when a script exceeds its maximum sleep time.
Other suitable options could include:
 * Process Watchdog: This emphasizes the monitoring aspect and the idea of "watching over" other processes.
 * Awakener: This highlights the function of bringing scripts back to life.
 * Task Resuscitator: A more technical term, implying the ability to revive stalled tasks.
However, Script Manager is generally the most straightforward and professional choice.
